export const aboutMeText = 'My name is Kristoffer Linderman, you can call me Krizz. I’m a happy-go-lucky person that also happens to like coding, computers and all things technology. I started studying computer science in 2015 and since then i’ve learned a lot, teached a bit and even done some research. in the end, my love for code took the best of me and I found myself working as a consultant in Malmö, Sweden. I have worked primarily as a full-stack web developer on projects ranging from 1 - 40 dev in size. I never shy away from laughter and like learning new things, both at work and outside. from learning spanish to rock climbing, I’ve tried a lot of things; I’m not great at any, but I enojy them nonetheless.'
